      <h1>About Us</h1>
      <p>The Rora Christian Fellowship Trust was founded in 1968 by Malcolm & Christine Ford and is currently run by Paul & Anna Ovens and a team of workers. It consists of a small Christian Conference Centre, with conferences run by Rora, or facilities available for use by groups etc to run their own program, and a place for Christians needing a place of rest, recovery or spiritual refreshment for short periods. There is also an Independent New Testament Fellowship based here. For more information click the 'Church' heading. Rora Christian Fellowship Trust is a work of faith and exists as a result of God's constant faithfulness.</p>

    <div class="aboutus" id="romania">
      <h1>Romania</h1>
      <p>Malcolm and Christine Ford started travelling to Romania in 1983. Following the revolution in 1989, a charity called Aurora Christian Association (or ACA for short) was formed, both in the UK and in Romania.

        The work of ACA is mainly run in the village of Vulcan, which is approx. 18 km from Brasov. We have many projects underway in Vulcan. Regular activities include 2 Kindergarten classes, homework club, canteen, boys and girls clubs, building projects etc. The canteen feeds 100 poor children and old people 1 meal a day, 5 days a week. We have a sponsorship programme for children in the canteen, sponsor leaflet available to download below). Aid, which is sent from the UK, is sorted and distributed to those in need. ACA currently have 2 properties next door to each other which are used for all the projects and hospitality, Casa Betania and Casa Betel.
        
        There are currently 8 Romanian workers committed to ACA, most of whom are sponsored from the UK.</p>

    <div class="aboutus" id="church">
      <h1>Church</h1>
      <p>There is an Independent New Testament church based at Rora House. The fellowship consists of committed Christians from the surrounding area.

        There is a meeting hall in the grounds of Rora House which holds 180 people, and is registered for Public Worship. The hall has an in-built central baptistery.
        
        We believe in the gifts of the Holy Spirit and the ministry of the word of God among us.
        
        Our focus is the Lord Jesus Christ as the Son of God. He alone is the Saviour of the world and giver of the Holy Spirit to all who obey Him.
        
        Jesus Christ transforms lives today setting men free from themselves and sin to serve the living God.
        
        We welcome visitors to all our meetings. Creche facilities and Sunday School are available on Sunday mornings. We also have a 'fellowship lunch' on Sundays after the meeting, all welcome.</p>
